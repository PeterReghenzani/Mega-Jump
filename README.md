# Mega-Jump
Basic Tutorial
## Step 1:
Select an `on chat command` from the 'Blue PLAYER menu' and rename it to *'jump'*.
## Step 2:
Place a `teleport to` from the 'PLAYER menu' inside `on chat command`.
## Step 3: 
Add a 'number parameter' to the `on chat command` by clicking the **(+)**. Make sure `num1` is slected.
Click on the 'Red VARIABLES menu' and use a variable called *'num1'* and place the it in the centre '0'. 
These spaces represent the X, Y and Z axis in that order. Y axis is height which we want to adjust as needed.
## Step 4:
Press the play button in the bottom right of the screen. Press 't' on your key board and type "jump 50" or even "jump 1000" to adjust your height.

# Extra
## Step 1:
Return to the Codemaker by pressing 'C'. Firstly we want to rename *'jump'* to *'x'* and move the `num1` variable to the first '0', the X Axis position.
## Step 2:
Duplicate the entire code block and change the `num1` variable to the Y axis (centre position). Rename the chat command to *'y*.
## Step 3:
Duplicate the entire code block and change the `num1` variable to the Z axis (left position). Rename the chat command to *'z*.
## Step 4: 
You should have 3 `on chat command` block, called X, Y and Z. Run the code by pressing the play button. Press *ESC* to get to your menu and go into your settings. Find 'World Options and activate *Show Coordinates'.

You can now 'Mega Jump' in any direction, using '-' to go backwards. Give it a try.
